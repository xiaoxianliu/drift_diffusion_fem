Brief description of folders in this directory

1. Basic functionalities
./triangle/
	* everything related to mesh generated by "triangle"
	* a "test" subfolder is included to generate a mesh using the source files in "./triangle/"
	* a "test_refine" subfolder is included to test refining a mesh using "./triangle/refine_mesh.cpp"
./fem_assemble/
	* matrix assembler; depend on "./triangle/" and "armadillo" and others when necessary
	* a "test" subfolder is included to test the source files in "./fem_assemble/"
	* a "convergence_test" subfolder is included to test the convergence of solver as mesh size decreases

2. Examples
./exciton_smart_geometry/
	* Designed a special "smart" interface with 1 hump
	* it's really just a rectangular zigzag interface, and its called "smart" because the organic solar cell community used it.

./exciton_interface_flux_cos_interface/
	* Mesh: a "cosine" interface with 1 period with the bump pointing to either side
	* Compute and plot state solution
	* compute and plot du/dnu (i.e. outward normal derivative) on the interface from either side ( "1" or "2")
./exciton_shape_gradient_cos_interface/
	* Mesh: a "cosine" interface with 1 period with the bump pointing to either side
	* Compute and plot state and adjoint solutions
	* Compute shape gradient on interface
