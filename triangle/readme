# This document describes what the source files in "triangle" do.

1. Initialization

(1) Form Meshdata0(input) for a 2x1 rectangle(vertices, interfaces, segments, attributes, etc)
Note: by default, the 4 boundary segments {left, bottom, right, top} are marked {1,2,3,4}, respectively. Interface segments are marked with 5. Interior edges are "0"s.

(2) Write Meshdata0 to a ".poly" file
File: write_polyfile.cpp

2. Generate new mesh
 Run "triangle" mesh generator from command line, which generate ".1.node", ".1.ele", ".1.edge", ".1.poly" files

3. Form new mesh
(1) Readin Meshdata1(output) from ".1.node", ".1.ele", ".1.edge"
Files: read_nodes.cpp, read_edges.cpp, read_elements.cpp

(2) Compute mesh topology (i.e. connectivity among mesh identities)
File: compute_topology.cpp

(3) Compute geometric quantities: 
	element areas
	edge lengths
File: geometric


4. Operations over new mesh
(1) Extract information of newly formed interface
File: interface.cpp

(2) plot mesh by Gnuplot
File: write_gnuplot.cpp
